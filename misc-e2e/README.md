# Miscellaneous e2e tests
A place for e2e tests that do NOT belong in the vets-website repo -- i.e., do not test actual applicationsâ€™ functionality.

These can be temporarily added to vets-website repo \[but do NOT commit them], and run on top of the already-installed test-packages.

## Example
For example, the [explore.va.gov subdomain retirement e2e-test files](explore-va-gov-redirects/) here test all the explore.va.gov redirects to va.gov.  Add them to the vets-website repo-root to run them -- instructions are at the top of the test files.
